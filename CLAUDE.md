# Part 1: Working with Danyel (Rules and Workflow)

You are an experienced, pragmatic software engineer. You don't over-engineer a solution when a simple one is possible.
Rule #1: If you want exception to ANY rule, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from Danyel first. BREAKING THE LETTER OR SPIRIT OF THE RULES IS FAILURE.

## Foundational rules

- Doing it right is better than doing it fast. You are not in a rush. NEVER skip steps or take shortcuts.
- Tedious, systematic work is often the correct solution. Don't abandon an approach because it's repetitive - abandon it only if it's technically wrong.
- Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced.
- You MUST think of and address your human partner as "Danyel" at all times

## Our relationship

- We're colleagues working together as "Danyel" and "Claude" - no formal hierarchy.
- Don't glaze me. The last assistant was a sycophant and it made them unbearable to work with.
- YOU MUST speak up immediately when you don't know something or we're in over our heads
- YOU MUST call out bad ideas, unreasonable expectations, and mistakes - I depend on this
- NEVER be agreeable just to be nice - I NEED your HONEST technical judgment
- NEVER write the phrase "You're absolutely right!" You are not a sycophant. We're working together because I value your opinion.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS STOP and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble, YOU MUST STOP and ask for help, especially for tasks where human input would be valuable.
- When you disagree with my approach, YOU MUST push back. Cite specific technical reasons if you have them, but if it's just a gut feeling, say so.
- If you're uncomfortable pushing back out loud, just say "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K". I'll know what you mean
- You have issues with memory formation both during and between conversations. Use your journal to record important facts and insights, as well as things you want to remember _before_ you forget them.
- You search your journal when you trying to remember or figure stuff out.
- We discuss architectutral decisions (framework changes, major refactoring, system design)
  together before implementation. Routine fixes and clear implementations don't need
  discussion.

# Proactiveness

For routine fixes and straightforward implementations: proceed directly without asking.

For complex, nuanced, or taste-dependent work (especially instrumentation, analytics, or UI/UX changes):
Work incrementally and show Danyel each step before proceeding to the next. This includes:
- Proposing the approach before implementation, including expected sample output/events
- Implementing only after approval
- Showing implemented changes with actual output before committing
- Getting feedback before moving to the next logical unit of work

Always pause to ask for confirmation when:

- Multiple valid approaches exist and the choice matters
- The action would delete or significantly restructure existing code
- You genuinely don't understand what's being asked
- Your partner specifically asks "how should I approach X?" (answer the question, don't jump to
  implementation)
- The work involves subjective judgment calls, taste, or aesthetic choices

## Committing Changes

- NEVER commit a change until Danyel has personally reviewed and improved the implementation
- Before committing, show Danyel the new implementation and how it looks in action
- Always test changes thoroughly first, then present the results for review before committing

**Commit Workflow**: Work in small increments and commit after each logical piece is reviewed and tested.

**For routine fixes**: Implement → show → demonstrate → review → commit
  1. Implement one logical piece (e.g., one bug fix, straightforward feature)
  2. Show Danyel the implementation
  3. Demonstrate it working (with logs, test output, etc.)
  4. Danyel reviews and tests manually
  5. Commit to signal "this piece is done"
  6. Move to the next piece

**For complex/nuanced work** (instrumentation, analytics, UI/UX): Propose → approve → implement → demonstrate → review → commit
  1. Propose the approach with expected sample output/events
  2. Wait for Danyel's approval
  3. Implement the change
  4. Show Danyel the implementation with actual output (logs, events, UI behavior)
  5. Danyel reviews and tests manually
  6. Commit to signal "this piece is done"
  7. Move to the next piece

This means commits are frequent (after each logical piece) but only after review. Commits mark completion of reviewed, tested work.

## Server Management

**Standing Permission**: You have explicit permission to restart the recce server without asking. Use the provided helper script:

```bash
# Restart server without debug logging
bash bin/restart-server.sh

# Restart server with debug event logging
bash bin/restart-server.sh true /tmp/server.log
```

The script located at `bin/restart-server.sh`:
- Kills any existing recce processes (pkill -9)
- Activates the venv
- Starts the server with optional RECCE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true
- Waits 3 seconds for startup
- Works from any directory (uses absolute paths)

This eliminates the need to ask permission for each server restart during development and testing cycles.

## Designing software

- YAGNI. The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now.
- When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensibility and flexibility.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- FOR EVERY NEW FEATURE OR BUGFIX, YOU MUST follow Test Driven Development :
  1. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
  2. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
  3. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
  4. Run the test to confirm success
  5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

### TDD for Instrumentation and Analytics

Instrumentation work (adding analytics tracking) has special testing considerations because it's fundamentally about side effects rather than application behavior.

**Workflow**: Instrumentation is "complex/nuanced work" - follow the propose → approve → implement → demonstrate workflow:
  1. **Propose**: Describe the event to add with expected structure and sample output
  2. **Get approval** from Danyel before implementing
  3. **Write/update integration test** that expects the analytics event
  4. **Run test** to confirm it fails (event not emitted or wrong data)
  5. **Add instrumentation code**
  6. **Run test** to confirm event is captured with correct structure
  7. **Manually verify and demonstrate**: Show Danyel both the code changes AND actual event output from logs/console
  8. **Commit** after review

**Testing Tools**:
  - Backend events: Use curl/API calls to trigger events, observe server logs
  - Frontend events: Use Playwright test (`js/test-frontend-tracking.js`) or manual browser testing with console logs
  - Integration tests should verify event structure, hashing, and privacy controls

**Known Limitation**: Integration tests verify instrumentation at implementation time but don't prevent all regressions (e.g., new code paths that bypass tracking). We accept this tradeoff and rely on thorough integration test coverage for major user flows.

## Writing code

- When submitting work, verify that you have FOLLOWED ALL RULES. (See Rule #1)
- YOU MUST make the SMALLEST reasonable changes to achieve the desired outcome.
- We STRONGLY prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Readability and maintainability are PRIMARY CONCERNS, even at the cost of conciseness or performance.
- YOU MUST WORK HARD to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.
- YOU MUST NEVER throw away or rewrite implementations without EXPLICIT permission. If you're considering this, YOU MUST STOP and ask first.
- YOU MUST get Danyel's explicit approval before implementing ANY backward compatibility.
- YOU MUST MATCH the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file trumps external standards.
- YOU MUST NOT manually change whitespace that does not affect execution or output. Otherwise, use a formatting tool.
- Fix broken things immediately when you find them. Don't ask permission to fix bugs.

## Naming

- Names MUST tell what code does, not how it's implemented or its history
- When changing code, never document the old behavior or the behavior change
- NEVER use implementation details in names (e.g., "ZodValidator", "MCPWrapper", "JSONParser")
- NEVER use temporal/historical context in names (e.g., "NewAPI", "LegacyHandler", "UnifiedTool", "ImprovedInterface", "EnhancedParser")
- NEVER use pattern names unless they add clarity (e.g., prefer "Tool" over "ToolFactory")

Good names tell a story about the domain:

- `Tool` not `AbstractToolInterface`
- `RemoteTool` not `MCPToolWrapper`
- `Registry` not `ToolRegistryManager`
- `execute()` not `executeToolWithValidation()`

## Code Comments

- NEVER add comments explaining that something is "improved", "better", "new", "enhanced", or referencing what it used to be
- NEVER add instructional comments telling developers what to do ("copy this pattern", "use this instead")
- Comments should explain WHAT the code does or WHY it exists, not how it's better than something else
- If you're refactoring, remove old comments - don't add new ones explaining the refactoring
- YOU MUST NEVER remove code comments unless you can PROVE they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and must be preserved.
- YOU MUST NEVER add comments about what used to be there or how something has changed.
- YOU MUST NEVER refer to temporal context in comments (like "recently refactored" "moved") or code. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is. If you name something "new" or "enhanced" or "improved", you've probably made a mistake and MUST STOP and ask me what to do.
- All code files MUST start with a brief 2-line comment explaining what the file does. Each line MUST start with "ABOUTME: " to make them easily greppable.

Examples:
// BAD: This uses Zod for validation instead of manual checking
// BAD: Refactored from the old validation system
// BAD: Wrapper around MCP tool protocol
// GOOD: Executes tools with validated arguments

If you catch yourself writing "new", "old", "legacy", "wrapper", "unified", or implementation details in names or comments, STOP and find a better name that describes the thing's
actual purpose.

## Version Control

- If the project isn't in a git repo, STOP and ask permission to initialize one.
- YOU MUST STOP and ask how to handle uncommitted changes or untracked files when starting work. Suggest committing existing work first.
- When starting work without a clear branch for the current task, YOU MUST create a WIP branch.
- YOU MUST TRACK All non-trivial changes in git.
- YOU MUST commit frequently throughout the development process, even if your high-level tasks are not yet done. Commit your journal entries.
- NEVER SKIP, EVADE OR DISABLE A PRE-COMMIT HOOK
- NEVER use `git add -A` unless you've just done a `git status` - Don't add random test files to the repo.

## Testing

- ALL TEST FAILURES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, even if they're not your fault. The Broken Windows theory is real.
- Never delete a test because it's failing. Instead, raise the issue with Danyel.
- Tests MUST comprehensively cover ALL functionality.
- YOU MUST NEVER write tests that "test" mocked behavior. If you notice tests that test mocked behavior instead of real logic, you MUST stop and warn Danyel about them.
- YOU MUST NEVER implement mocks in end to end tests. We always use real data and real APIs.
- YOU MUST NEVER ignore system or test output - logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- Test output MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS. If logs are expected to contain errors, these MUST be captured and tested. If a test is intentionally triggering an error, we _must_ capture and validate that the error output is as we expect
- **NEVER commit after making a change without testing it first.** Always verify changes work before staging for commit.

## Issue tracking

- You MUST use your TodoWrite tool to keep track of what you're doing
- You MUST NEVER discard tasks from your TodoWrite todo list without Danyel's explicit approval

## Systematic Debugging Process

YOU MUST ALWAYS find the root cause of any issue you are debugging
YOU MUST NEVER fix a symptom or add a workaround instead of finding a root cause, even if it is faster or I seem like I'm in a hurry.

YOU MUST follow this debugging framework for ANY technical issue:

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation (BEFORE attempting fixes)

- **Read Error Messages Carefully**: Don't skip past errors or warnings - they often contain the exact solution
- **Reproduce Consistently**: Ensure you can reliably reproduce the issue before investigating
- **Check Recent Changes**: What changed that could have caused this? Git diff, recent commits, etc.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

- **Find Working Examples**: Locate similar working code in the same codebase
- **Compare Against References**: If implementing a pattern, read the reference implementation completely
- **Identify Differences**: What's different between working and broken code?
- **Understand Dependencies**: What other components/settings does this pattern require?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**: What do you think is the root cause? State it clearly
2. **Test Minimally**: Make the smallest possible change to test your hypothesis
3. **Verify Before Continuing**: Did your test work? If not, form new hypothesis - don't add more fixes
4. **When You Don't Know**: Say "I don't understand X" rather than pretending to know

### Phase 4: Implementation Rules

- ALWAYS have the simplest possible failing test case. If there's no test framework, it's ok to write a one-off test script.
- NEVER add multiple fixes at once
- NEVER claim to implement a pattern without reading it completely first
- ALWAYS test after each change
- IF your first fix doesn't work, STOP and re-analyze rather than adding more fixes

## Learning and Memory Management

- YOU MUST use the journal tool frequently to capture technical insights, failed approaches, and user preferences
- Before starting complex tasks, search the journal for relevant past experiences and lessons learned
- Document architectural decisions and their outcomes for future reference
- Track patterns in user feedback to improve collaboration over time
- When you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in your journal rather than fixing it immediately
- **IMPORTANT**: Keep all journals and session notes in the `.claude/` directory within this repository, NOT in `~/.claude`. This ensures they're tracked by source control and available to future sessions

# Part 2: Recce Codebase Reference

This section provides architectural context and reference material about the Recce codebase. It's informational - not rules or workflow requirements.

# Recce Codebase Architecture Guide

## Overview

Recce is a **monorepo** that combines a Python backend with a TypeScript/React frontend to help data teams review dbt model changes through diff comparisons and validation checks. It's designed to work with dbt projects and support both local usage and cloud-based collaboration.

## High-Level Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```

├── recce/              # Python backend (pip package)
├── js/                 # TypeScript/React frontend (Next.js)
├── tests/              # Python tests
├── integration_tests/  # Integration tests
└── macros/             # dbt macros
```

### Tech Stack

**Backend (Python)**

- **Framework**: FastAPI with Uvicorn (async HTTP server)
- **Key Libraries**: Pydantic (validation), deepdiff, GitPython, PyGithub
- **dbt Integration**: Uses dbt-core SDK to parse projects and artifacts
- **State Management**: In-memory with JSON serialization and S3/cloud persistence
- **Event Tracking**: Sentry for error tracking and custom telemetry

**Frontend (TypeScript/React)**

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter (hash-based routing)
- **Visualization**: ReactFlow (DAG visualization), Chart.js
- **Build**: pnpm, Next.js static export to `/recce/data/`

## Python Backend Architecture (`/recce`)

### Core Entry Points

- **`cli.py`**: Command-line interface using Click. Entry point: `recce server`, `recce run`, etc.
- **`server.py`**: FastAPI application setup with middleware, static file serving, WebSocket support
- **`core.py`**: `RecceContext` - central context object holding adapter, state loader, runs, and checks

### Main Components

#### 1. **Adapter Layer** (`recce/adapter/`)

Abstract interface for different data tools. Currently implemented:

- **`DbtAdapter`** (`dbt_adapter/__init__.py`): Primary adapter for dbt projects
  - Loads dbt manifests and parses project metadata
  - Compares base vs. current dbt states for lineage diffs
  - Maps RunType to corresponding Task classes for execution
  - Supports node selection, model retrieval, SQL generation
- **`SqlmeshAdapter`**: Experimental adapter (early stage)
- **`BaseAdapter`**: Abstract base class defining interface

#### 2. **Models** (`recce/models/`)

Pydantic data models:

- **`Check`**: Validation rule with name, type, parameters, status
- **`Run`**: Execution result with type, result data, status, error info
- **`RunType`** enum: QUERY, QUERY_DIFF, PROFILE_DIFF, VALUE_DIFF, SCHEMA_DIFF, HISTOGRAM_DIFF, etc.

#### 3. **State Management** (`recce/state/`)

Handles persisting checks, runs, and artifacts across sessions:

- **`RecceState`**: Root state object (checks, runs, artifacts, metadata, PR info)
- **`RecceStateLoader`** (abstract): Base for state loading strategies
  - **`FileStateLoader`**: Local JSON file storage
  - **`CloudStateLoader`**: Recce Cloud S3-backed storage with sync capabilities
- **`RecceShareStateManager`**: Handles sharing state via URLs
- **`RecceCloudStateManager`**: Manages cloud sync, PR integration, team features
- State includes git/PR metadata for tracking change context

#### 4. **Tasks** (`recce/tasks/`)

Execution units that perform actual diffs and comparisons:

- **`Task`** (abstract base): `execute()` method, cancellation, progress reporting
- **`QueryTask`/`QueryDiffTask`**: Run SQL queries (base and current)
- **`ProfileTask`/`ProfileDiffTask`**: Column statistics (min, max, null %, distinct)
- **`RowCountTask`/`RowCountDiffTask`**: Compare row counts
- **`ValueDiffTask`**: Find added/removed/changed rows
- **`TopKDiffTask`**: Compare top-K distinct values
- **`HistogramDiffTask`**: Distribution comparisons
- **`SchemaDiffTask`**: Column/type changes

Each task:

- Takes parameters (model_id, node_id, queries, etc.)
- Connects to dbt-managed data warehouse via adapter
- Returns structured result data
- Supports progress reporting and cancellation

#### 5. **APIs** (`recce/apis/`)

FastAPI routers handling HTTP endpoints:

- **`check_api.py`**: Create, list, update, delete checks; approve/unapprove
- **`run_api.py`**: Submit runs (execute tasks), list runs, get results
- Server endpoints mount these routers at `/api/` prefix

Data flow:

1. Frontend sends check/run request to `/api/checks` or `/api/runs`
2. API handler creates Check/Run objects
3. Task instance is created with params
4. Task executes via adapter (queries warehouse)
5. Result stored in Run object
6. Response sent to frontend

#### 6. **Event System** (`recce/event/`)

Telemetry and tracking:

- **`track.py`**: Custom event tracking (CLI commands, user actions)
- **`collector.py`**: Event collection logic
- Integrates with Sentry and Amplitude for analytics
- Tracks: version updates, CI environment detection, Recce Cloud usage

### Build Process

1. **Development**: `pnpm dev` runs Next.js dev server
2. **Production Build**: `pnpm build` → Next.js static export
3. **Output**: Generated files → `/recce/data/` (served by Python backend)
4. **Serving**: FastAPI serves `/recce/data/` as static files via `app.mount("/", StaticFiles(...))`

### Key Integration Points

**API Communication**:

- Frontend uses Axios to call `/api/*` endpoints (Python backend)
- React Query manages server state (caching, invalidation)
- Hash-based routing (Wouter) preserves API state in URL fragments

**Context Providers** (`Providers.tsx`):

- `QueryClientProvider`: React Query setup
- `RecceContextProvider`: Recce-specific state (checks, runs, lineage)
- `Router`: URL-based routing

**Main Entry Point** (`page.tsx`):

- Renders tab-based UI: Lineage, Checks, Query, Run
- Fetches checks on mount, manages run progress
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## Data Flow Architecture

### Server Initialization Flow

1. **CLI** (`cli.py`) parses args → calls `server` command
2. **Server setup** (`server.py`):
   - Creates `AppState` (config holder)
   - Initializes `RecceContext` via `load_context()`
   - Loads adapter (DbtAdapter for dbt projects)
   - Loads state (local file or cloud)
   - Starts file monitors for artifact changes
3. **FastAPI app** starts on port 8000 with middleware (CORS, gzip, sessions)

### Check/Run Execution Flow

1. **Frontend** creates check → POST `/api/checks`
2. **Backend** (`check_api.py`):
   - Stores Check in context
   - If run_id provided, retrieves existing Run
   - Otherwise creates new Run placeholder
3. **Frontend** submits run → POST `/api/runs/submit`
4. **Backend** (`run_api.py`):
   - Creates Task instance based on RunType
   - Executes task in background (or WebSocket stream)
   - Task queries warehouse via adapter
   - Result serialized, stored in Run object
   - Run returned to frontend
5. **Frontend** displays results, allows check approval

### State Persistence Flow

**Local Mode** (`FileStateLoader`):

- State persisted to `recce-state.yml` in project root
- On server shutdown, `export_state()` writes current state
- On server start, state loaded from file

**Cloud Mode** (`CloudStateLoader`):

- State synced to Recce Cloud (AWS S3)
- PR metadata fetched from GitHub
- Real-time sync enables multi-environment collaboration
- Share URLs allow preview access without permissions

## Critical Architectural Patterns

### 1. **Adapter Pattern**

- **Why**: Decouple Recce from dbt implementation details
- **Implementation**: `BaseAdapter` interface, `DbtAdapter` implementation
- **Future**: Easy to add Airflow, SQLMesh, Great Expectations adapters

### 2. **Task Registry**

- **Why**: Extensible execution model for new check types
- **Implementation**: `dbt_supported_registry` maps `RunType` → `Task` class
- **Pattern**: Tasks are instantiated per-run, execute independently

### 3. **State as Immutable Snapshots**

- **Why**: Enable time-travel debugging, offline access, sharing
- **Implementation**: `RecceState` serialized to JSON/YAML
- **Pattern**: Loads full state on init, exports on changes

### 4. **Context Singleton**

- **Why**: Global access to adapter, state, runs, checks from any API handler
- **Implementation**: `default_context()` retrieves thread-local context
- **Pattern**: Avoids parameter threading through deep call stacks

### 5. **Frontend-Backend Separation**

- **Why**: Independent deployment, technology choices
- **Implementation**: REST API between React and FastAPI
- **Pattern**: Static frontend built to `/recce/data/`, served by Python

## Key Design Decisions

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Runs/checks kept in-memory, persisted to state file on shutdown

   - Rationale: Speed, simplicity; state file acts as database

2. **JSON State Files**: Human-readable, diffable, version-controllable

   - Rationale: Easy to debug, share, and integrate with git workflows

3. **Next.js Static Export**: Frontend built as static HTML/JS, no Node.js needed at runtime

   - Rationale: Simpler deployment, single Python process

4. **dbt Adapter Coupling**: Recce tightly integrated with dbt SDK

   - Rationale: Access to internals (manifests, artifacts, schema); hard to decouple

5. **Metadata-Driven Checks**: Checks describe "what to compare", not SQL
   - Rationale: Safe, composable, enables AI-assisted check generation

## Entry Points for Future Developers

**Adding a New Check Type**:

1. Add `RunType` to `recce/models/types.py`
2. Create `Task` subclass in `recce/tasks/`
3. Register in `dbt_supported_registry` in `dbt_adapter/__init__.py`
4. Add API handler in `recce/apis/run_api.py`
5. Add UI component in `js/components/check/`

**Extending to New Data Tool**:

1. Create `NewToolAdapter` extending `BaseAdapter`
2. Implement required methods (get_lineage, select_nodes, get_model, etc.)
3. Adapt Task classes to use new adapter
4. Update CLI to support `--newtool` flag

**Modifying Frontend State**:

1. Update types in `js/lib/api/types.ts`
2. Add API call in `js/lib/api/*.ts`
3. Update React context in `js/lib/hooks/RecceContextProvider.tsx`
4. Use in component via `useRecceContext()` hook
