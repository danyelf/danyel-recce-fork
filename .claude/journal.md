### Debugging Tip: Capturing Server Output with Event Logging

**Problem:** Need to capture event log output from running recce server with `RECCE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true` to verify instrumentation changes.

**Failed Approaches (Don't Use):**
- `subprocess.Popen()` with stdout capture → hard to debug, process timing issues
- `BashOutput` tool with background processes → requires polling, slow feedback loop
- `timeout` command → NOT AVAILABLE ON macOS (use `pkill -9` instead)
- Multiple retries of subprocess approach → token waste
- Complex bash chains with pipes → hard to control process lifecycle

**Working Solution (Tested Oct 22):**
Use simple file redirection with `> /tmp/file.log 2>&1`:

```bash
# Kill any existing processes first
pkill -9 -f "recce server" || true
sleep 1

# Start server with output to file
cd /path/to/project && source /path/to/venv/bin/activate && \
  RECCE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true recce server > /tmp/all_events_test.log 2>&1 &
sleep 3

# Trigger the event
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/info > /dev/null

# Wait for logging
sleep 1

# Kill the server
pkill -9 -f "recce server"
sleep 2

# Read the results
cat /tmp/all_events_test.log
```

**Key Points:**
- Kill existing processes with `pkill -9` (force) first - don't try to be gentle
- Redirect stdout AND stderr to file upfront: `> /tmp/file.log 2>&1 &`
- Background with `&` at end of command
- Give server 3 seconds to initialize
- Trigger any events you want to capture (API calls, UI actions)
- Wait 1 second for the logging to flush
- Kill with `pkill -9` (don't wait for graceful shutdown)
- Simple `cat` to read the accumulated log
- **Don't overthink the timing** - 3s startup, 1s trigger, 2s cleanup is robust

**Why This Works:**
- File-based I/O is simpler than process communication
- You can read the log after the process is dead
- No need for `timeout` (macOS doesn't have it)
- No polling or background tool management needed
- Fast iteration loop: write, run, read result

**Result:** Get immediate output like:
```
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] load_state {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] environment_snapshot {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [Performance] model lineage {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] viewed_lineage {}
```

## Technical Notes

### Change Status Tracking Implementation
- Removed `model_color_counts` (visual color assignments)
- Added `new_nodes`, `modified_nodes`, `unchanged_nodes` (semantic change status)
- Uses base/current lineage comparison to accurately determine node status
- Filters out test nodes to avoid contaminating counts
- Event format: `[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [Performance] model lineage {...}`
