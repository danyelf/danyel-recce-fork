### Debugging Tip: Capturing Server Output with Event Logging

**Problem:** Need to capture event log output from running recce server with `RECCE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true` to verify instrumentation changes.

**Failed Approaches (Don't Use):**
- `subprocess.Popen()` with stdout capture → hard to debug, process timing issues
- `BashOutput` tool with background processes → requires polling, slow feedback loop
- `timeout` command → NOT AVAILABLE ON macOS (use `pkill -9` instead)
- Multiple retries of subprocess approach → token waste
- Complex bash chains with pipes → hard to control process lifecycle

**Working Solution (Tested Oct 22):**
Use simple file redirection with `> /tmp/file.log 2>&1`:

```bash
# Kill any existing processes first
pkill -9 -f "recce server" || true
sleep 1

# Start server with output to file
cd /path/to/project && source /path/to/venv/bin/activate && \
  RECCE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true recce server > /tmp/all_events_test.log 2>&1 &
sleep 3

# Trigger the event
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/info > /dev/null

# Wait for logging
sleep 1

# Kill the server
pkill -9 -f "recce server"
sleep 2

# Read the results
cat /tmp/all_events_test.log
```

**Key Points:**
- Kill existing processes with `pkill -9` (force) first - don't try to be gentle
- Redirect stdout AND stderr to file upfront: `> /tmp/file.log 2>&1 &`
- Background with `&` at end of command
- Give server 3 seconds to initialize
- Trigger any events you want to capture (API calls, UI actions)
- Wait 1 second for the logging to flush
- Kill with `pkill -9` (don't wait for graceful shutdown)
- Simple `cat` to read the accumulated log
- **Don't overthink the timing** - 3s startup, 1s trigger, 2s cleanup is robust

**Why This Works:**
- File-based I/O is simpler than process communication
- You can read the log after the process is dead
- No need for `timeout` (macOS doesn't have it)
- No polling or background tool management needed
- Fast iteration loop: write, run, read result

**Result:** Get immediate output like:
```
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] load_state {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] environment_snapshot {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [Performance] model lineage {...}
[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [User] viewed_lineage {}
```

### Creating Clean PR Branches from Working Branches

**Context:** After making many commits with development artifacts (.claude/, CLAUDE.md, test scripts, bin/), we need to create a clean single-commit PR with only production code.

**Process (Tested and Working):**

```bash
# 1. Sync working branch first
git push -f origin working-branch-name

# 2. Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# 3. Create clean branch and squash merge
git checkout -b clean-pr-branch origin/main
git merge --squash working-branch-name
# DON'T COMMIT YET - changes are staged

# 4. Unstage unwanted files
git reset HEAD .claude/
git reset HEAD CLAUDE.md
git reset HEAD bin/
git reset HEAD test_scripts/
git reset HEAD js/test-*.js
git reset HEAD js/package.json js/package-lock.json  # if they only added test deps

# 5. Remove from working directory
rm -rf .claude/ CLAUDE.md bin/ test_scripts/ js/test-*.js
rmdir any-empty-dirs/  # if rm left empty directories

# 6. Restore package files if needed (to remove test-only deps like playwright)
git checkout origin/main -- js/package.json js/package-lock.json

# 7. VERIFY what's staged
git status
git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD

# 8. Commit and push
git commit -m "Your PR message"
git push -u origin clean-pr-branch
```

**Critical Lessons:**
1. **ALWAYS check package.json changes** - Test dependencies (playwright, etc.) shouldn't go in production PRs
2. **Use `git reset HEAD` to unstage** - Not `git checkout --` (that's for files that exist on base branch)
3. **Empty directories remain after `rm -rf`** - Use `rmdir` to clean up
4. **Verify before committing** - Use `git diff --name-only` to see exactly what changed
5. **File counts matter** - If squash added 11 files but you expect 9, investigate

**When to Use:**
- Working branch has many commits with iteration/debugging
- Need single clean commit for upstream PR
- Development artifacts mixed with production code
- Want to preserve working branch history but clean up PR

**Result:**
- Working branch preserved with full history
- Clean PR branch with single descriptive commit
- Only production code, no dev artifacts
- Easy for maintainers to review

## Technical Notes

### Change Status Tracking Implementation
- Removed `model_color_counts` (visual color assignments)
- Added `new_nodes`, `modified_nodes`, `unchanged_nodes` (semantic change status)
- Uses base/current lineage comparison to accurately determine node status
- Filters out test nodes to avoid contaminating counts
- Event format: `[RECCE_DEBUG] Logging event: [Performance] model lineage {...}`
