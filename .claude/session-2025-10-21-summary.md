# Session Summary - October 21, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical Bug in `environment_snapshot` Event ✅

**Problem**: Event was reporting `has_base_env: False` and `has_current_env: False` even though manifests existed.

**Root Cause**: The `manifest.metadata.generated_at` field is already a `datetime` object, but code was calling `datetime.fromisoformat()` on it, causing `TypeError` which was silently caught.

**Fix**: Removed `datetime.fromisoformat()` calls - use datetime objects directly.

**Files Changed**:

- `recce/event/__init__.py:384, 395, 409, 420`

**Result**: Event now correctly reports manifest ages (~1463 hours for base, ~1103 hours for current)

### 2. Tested All Python Backend Events ✅

Systematically tested all 10 Python backend events using API calls:

| Event                                | Status     | Trigger                  | Notes                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `load_state`                         | ✅ Working | Server startup           | Tracks initial state            |
| `environment_snapshot`               | ✅ Working | Server startup           | Now shows correct manifest ages |
| `session_milestone` (viewed_lineage) | ✅ Working | GET `/api/info`          | Fires once per session          |
| `create_check`                       | ✅ Working | POST `/api/checks`       | Enriched with source detection  |
| `session_milestone` (created_check)  | ✅ Working | First check created      | Deduplication working           |
| `create_run`                         | ✅ Working | POST `/api/runs`         | Feature usage tracking          |
| `session_milestone` (ran_check)      | ✅ Working | First run submitted      | Deduplication working           |
| `run_completed`                      | ✅ Working | Run finishes             | Tracks duration, status, errors |
| `check_approved`                     | ✅ Working | PATCH `/api/checks/{id}` | Tracks approval state           |
| `session_milestone` (approved_check) | ✅ Working | First check approved     | Deduplication working           |

All events verified with correct:

- ✅ Hashed IDs (SHA256)
- ✅ Privacy (no raw data)
- ✅ Session deduplication

### 3. Created Debugging Documentation ✅

**New File**: `.claude/debugging-recce-python.md`

Documents the complete workflow for:

- Installing in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- Testing with API calls instead of browser
- Debugging techniques (print statements, type checking)
- Common gotchas (dbt Pydantic models, silent exceptions)
- File locations reference
- Quick debugging checklist

### 4. Started Frontend Testing Setup ⏳

- Added debug logging to `trackTabChanged()` in `js/src/lib/api/track.ts`
- Created Playwright test script: `test-frontend-tracking.js`
- Playwright installed in `js/` directory
- **Status**: Script ready but not tested yet (module path issue to resolve)

## Current State

### Files Modified (Not Committed)

Note -- these files were commmitted and pushed after this summary file was created.

```
M  recce/event/__init__.py            # Bug fix + removed debug prints
M  js/src/lib/api/track.ts            # Added console.log for dev mode
?? .claude/debugging-recce-python.md  # New debugging guide
?? test-frontend-tracking.js          # Playwright test (needs path fix)
```

### What's Working

- All Python backend events are firing correctly
- Event logging visible in server console
- API-based testing workflow documented and working
- Debugging workflow established

### What's Pending

- Frontend `tab_changed` event testing with Playwright
- Need to fix module path (Playwright installed in `js/`, script at root)
- Remove debug `console.log` after testing
- Update `.claude/phase1-implementation-summary.md` with test results

## To Resume Tomorrow

### Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Activate editable install
cd /Users/danyel/code/danyel-recce-fork
pip install -e .

# 1. Start server
cd /Users/danyel/code/jaffle_shop_duckdb
recce server

# 2. In another terminal, test Python events
cd /Users/danyel/code/danyel-recce-fork
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/info > /dev/null  # Triggers events

# 3. Test frontend (after fixing module path)
cd js
npx playwright test ../test-frontend-tracking.js
```

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Playwright test**:

   - Move test script to `js/` directory OR
   - Install Playwright at root level
   - Run test to verify `tab_changed` event

2. **Clean up debug code**:

   - Remove `console.log` from `track.ts` (or keep for dev mode)
   - Remove debug prints from Python code

3. **Update documentation**:

   - Add frontend testing workflow to debugging guide
   - Update phase1-implementation-summary.md with test results
   - Document Playwright test as part of testing workflow

4. **Consider committing**:
   - Bug fix is ready to commit
   - Debugging documentation is valuable to keep
   - Decision on whether to keep dev mode logging

## Key Commands Reference

```bash
# Testing Python Backend Events
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/info                    # viewed_lineage
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/checks -d '{...}'  # create_check
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/runs -d '{...}'    # create_run
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/checks/{id} -d '{...}'  # check_approved

# Check server logs
# Look for lines: "Logging event: <event_name> {...}"

# Kill all recce servers
pkill -f "recce server"
```

## Questions to Consider Tomorrow

1. Should we keep the `console.log` debug output in dev mode permanently? (No! But we can keep it temporarily for easier debugging, and we should make it easy to disable)
2. Should we add similar debug logging to other frontend tracking functions?
3. Should the Playwright test be part of the regular test suite?
4. Do we want to test error cases (e.g., run failures, invalid data)?

## Context for Next Session

- Working directory: `/Users/danyel/code/danyel-recce-fork`
- Test project: `/Users/danyel/code/jaffle_shop_duckdb`
- Python editable install is active
- Playwright installed in `js/` via npm/pnpm
- All Phase 1 backend instrumentation is working
- Frontend instrumentation added but not tested
