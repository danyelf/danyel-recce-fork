# Session Summary - October 22, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Verified All Python Backend Events Working ✅

Tested all 10 Python backend events using API calls to the running server:

| Event | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `load_state` | ✅ Working | Fires on server startup |
| `environment_snapshot` | ✅ Working | Shows correct manifest ages (~331 hours) |
| `session_milestone` (viewed_lineage) | ✅ Working | Fires when accessing /api/info |
| `api_event` (create_check) | ✅ Working | Fires with hashed check IDs (SHA256) |
| `api_event` (create_run) | ✅ Working | Fires when submitting runs |
| `run_completed` | ✅ Working | Includes duration and status |
| `api_event` (check_approved) | ✅ Working | Fires when approving checks |

All events verified with:
- ✅ Proper hashing (SHA256 for sensitive IDs)
- ✅ No privacy violations
- ✅ Correct data payloads

### 2. Fixed Frontend Tab Tracking (Multiple Events) ✅

**Problem**: Frontend `tab_changed` event tracking was implemented, but only the first tab click was firing the event. Subsequent tab clicks didn't trigger `onValueChange` handler.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` hook was updating `valueLocation` state whenever the URL changed (via wouter router). This interrupted Chakra UI Tabs' internal state management, preventing `onValueChange` from firing on user-initiated clicks after the initial one.

**Solution**: Added a ref flag (`isUserTabClickRef`) in `page.tsx` to distinguish between:
- **User-initiated tab clicks**: Set flag before state updates, skip the state overwrite in useEffect
- **Programmatic navigation**: No flag set, allow useEffect to sync URL to component state

**Code Changes**:
- `js/app/page.tsx:323`: Added `const isUserTabClickRef = React.useRef(false);`
- `js/app/page.tsx:349-354`: Modified useEffect to skip state updates when flag is set
- `js/app/page.tsx:380`: Set flag after handling user click to prevent useEffect interference
- `js/src/lib/api/track.ts:131`: Kept simple `NODE_ENV === "development"` check for debug logging

**Result**: ✅ All 3 tab change events now captured correctly!
```
1. [Frontend] Tracking tab_changed: {from_tab: null, to_tab: /query, time_on_previous_tab_seconds: null}
2. [Frontend] Tracking tab_changed: {from_tab: /query, to_tab: /checks, time_on_previous_tab_seconds: 3.84}
3. [Frontend] Tracking tab_changed: {from_tab: /checks, to_tab: /lineage, time_on_previous_tab_seconds: 3.925}
```

### 3. Improved Playwright Test ✅

**Test Setup**:
- Playwright test script: `js/test-frontend-tracking.js`
- Uses `data-value` attribute selectors for reliable tab clicking
- Improved dialog dismissal by clicking "Skip" button instead of Escape key
- Captures and filters console logs for tracking events

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Successfully captures all 3 tab change tracking events
- ✅ Correct from_tab → to_tab transitions
- ✅ Timing calculations accurate (time_on_previous_tab_seconds)
- ✅ Test validates expected 3 events with success message

### 4. Cleaned Up Code ✅

**Removed**:
- Deleted debug `print()` statement from `recce/event/__init__.py:175`
- Removed unnecessary `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECCE_DEBUG` environment variable
- Restored accidentally deleted production files from `/recce/data/` (index.html, 404.html, etc.)

**Kept**:
- Conditional console logging in `trackTabChanged()` (gated behind `NODE_ENV === "development"`)
- Simple and effective for development and testing without extra environment variables

## Current State

```

### What's Working
- ✅ All Python backend events firing correctly with proper data and hashing
- ✅ All 3 frontend tab change events captured in sequence
- ✅ Playwright test validates tab tracking with correct transitions and timing
- ✅ Code is clean with no debug statements or unnecessary environment variables

### Key Technical Fix
The fundamental issue was controlled vs uncontrolled component state in Chakra UI Tabs. The `useEffect` was overwriting the Tabs component's internal state on every URL change, preventing `onValueChange` from firing. Using a ref flag to distinguish user clicks from programmatic navigation solved this without compromising either capability.

## Testing Quick Start

### Test Python Backend Events
```bash
# Start server
cd /Users/danyel/code/jaffle_shop_duckdb
recce server

# In another terminal, trigger events
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/info > /dev/null  # viewed_lineage event
```

### Test Frontend Tracking
```bash
# Start dev server (NODE_ENV=development automatically in dev mode)
cd /Users/danyel/code/danyel-recce-fork/js
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, run test
cd /Users/danyel/code/danyel-recce-fork/js
node test-frontend-tracking.js
```

## Files to Review Before Committing
